## How To ##
The application jar can be built by downloading the Repository and running the command **mvn package**  
from TwoDates folder.

This will create a **target** folder with **TwoDates-1.0.jar**.

To run the jar, **cd** to **TwoDates/target** and run **java -jar TwoDates-1.0.jar**.  
This deploys the API on port **8080**.

1. http://localhost:8080/dates

Both the above endpoints will render the required HTML.
